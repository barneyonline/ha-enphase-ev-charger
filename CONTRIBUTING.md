# Contributing to Enphase EV Charger 2 (Cloud)

Thanks for helping improve this Home Assistant custom integration! We follow Home Assistant and HACS standards to keep the project healthy and dependable. Please read through this guide before opening a pull request.

## Code of Conduct

By participating you agree to uphold the [Home Assistant Code of Conduct](https://www.home-assistant.io/code_of_conduct/). Be respectful and inclusive when interacting with the community.

## How to Help

- Report reproducible bugs and attach diagnostics or logs where possible.
- Suggest enhancements or improvements to documentation.
- Contribute code, tests, translations, or quality scale compliance work.
- Review open pull requests and share constructive feedback.

Before starting large features, open an issue or discussion so we can agree on scope and fit.

## Development Workflow

1. **Fork and clone** the repository.
2. **Create a feature branch** (`feature/...`, `bugfix/...`, or `docs/...`) from the latest `main`.
3. **Install dependencies** in a virtual environment:
   ```bash
   python -m venv .venv
   source .venv/bin/activate
   pip install --upgrade pip
   pip install -r devtools/docker/requirements-dev.txt
   ```
   The requirements mirror our CI jobs, which currently target Python 3.12 and 3.13.
4. **Develop and test** your changes.
5. **Commit with clear messages** and push your branch.
6. **Open a pull request** using the template. Fill in every section and link any related issues.

### Optional Docker workflow

We provide a reproducible environment under `devtools/docker/`:

```bash
docker compose -f devtools/docker/docker-compose.yml build ha-dev
docker compose -f devtools/docker/docker-compose.yml run --rm ha-dev bash -lc "pytest"
docker compose -f devtools/docker/docker-compose.yml run --rm ha-dev bash -lc "pre-commit run --all-files"
```

## Coding Standards and Tooling

Home Assistant integrations must follow the [core development guidelines](https://developers.home-assistant.io/docs/development_guidelines/). Key points:

- Use modern Python syntax (f-strings, type hints) and keep logging format strings lazy.
- Interact with external services via dedicated client libraries or well-structured helpers.
- Use Google-style docstrings when detailed documentation is needed.
- Keep YAML and documentation formatting consistent with the [Home Assistant style guide](https://developers.home-assistant.io/docs/documenting/yaml-style-guide/).

This repository relies on the following checks. Please run them locally before pushing:

```bash
ruff check .
black custom_components/enphase_ev
pytest -q tests_enphase_ev
python scripts/validate_quality_scale.py
pre-commit run --all-files
```

> hassfest validation runs automatically in CI via [`home-assistant/actions/hassfest`](https://github.com/home-assistant/actions/tree/master/hassfest). If you need to run it locally, clone the Home Assistant Core repository and execute `python -m script.hassfest` from your integration checkout.

> Tip: `pre-commit` helps maintain formatting by running the configured hooks automatically. Install it with `pip install pre-commit` and enable with `pre-commit install`.

## Translations

- Place new or updated translations under `custom_components/enphase_ev/translations/<language>.json`.
- Follow Home Assistant’s translation conventions (language files use native phrasing and mirror English keys). When adding a new language, ensure the manifest `version` and documentation reflect the addition and include both the English and native language names where applicable.
- Keep JSON alphabetised and valid UTF-8 (ASCII is preferred unless the language requires accented characters).

## Documentation and Changelog

- Update `README.md` when behaviour, options, or supported features change. Include new configuration parameters using the recommended `configuration_basic` formatting when appropriate.
- Record user-facing changes in `CHANGELOG.md` under an `Unreleased` entry (or add a new version section when preparing a release).

## Tests

- Add or update tests in `tests_enphase_ev/` for new functionality or bug fixes.
- Ensure pytest remains fast and deterministic; prefer fixtures over network calls.
- If adding significant functionality, mention how you verified it in the PR description and consider attaching diagnostics captured via Home Assistant’s download tools.

## Pull Request Expectations

- Keep pull requests focused. Separate refactors from functional changes.
- Rebase on top of the latest `main` before requesting review to avoid merge conflicts.
- Ensure GitHub Actions workflows (`tests`, `hassfest`, `Validate`, and `Quality Scale`) pass. They mirror the commands listed above and help maintain HACS compliance (`hacs/action` requires the repository to meet manifest, structure, and metadata checks).
- For UI or translation changes, include screenshots or highlight impacted strings.

## Release Process

Maintainers cut releases by updating the manifest version, changelog, and tagging the release. Contributors generally do not publish releases directly, but you can help by keeping entries in `CHANGELOG.md` clear and actionable.

## Getting Help

Open a discussion or issue if you are blocked. When in doubt, reference:

- [Home Assistant developer documentation](https://developers.home-assistant.io/) for integration patterns and quality scale rules.
- [HACS documentation](https://hacs.xyz/docs/) for repository requirements, including manifests and validation expectations.
